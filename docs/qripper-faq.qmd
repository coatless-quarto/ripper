# General Information

## What is the {ripper} extension for Quarto?

The `{ripper}` extension for Quarto is a filter that automatically extracts code blocks from 
your document and splits them by programming language into separate, executable script files.
It helps you maintain both literate programming documents and standalone scripts from a single source,
improving code reusability.

## What types of code blocks does {ripper} extract?

The `{ripper}` extension extracts all code blocks with supported language identifiers, including:

- **R code**: Creates `.R` files
- **Python code**: Creates `.py` files
- **Julia code**: Creates `.jl` files
- And 13 other languages (see supported languages below)

All extracted code blocks maintain their original execution order from the document.

# Installation

## How do I install the {ripper} extension?

To install the `ripper` Quarto extension, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Execute the following command:

```sh
quarto add coatless-quarto/ripper
```

Your project structure should look like:

```
your-project/
├── _extensions/
│   └── coatless-quarto/
│       └── ripper/
│           ├── _extension.yml
│           └── ripper.lua
└── your-document.qmd
```

## Is the {ripper} extension compatible with all Quarto versions?

The `{ripper}` extension requires Quarto v1.7 or later.

## Do I need to install any additional dependencies?

No additional dependencies are required. The `{ripper}` extension is a pure Lua filter that works with Quarto's built-in Pandoc processing.

# Usage and Customization

## How do I enable the {ripper} extension in my document?

After installing the extension, add it to your document's YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Analysis"
filters:
  - ripper
---
```

When you render the document, script files will be automatically created in the same directory as your output file.

## Can I control whether YAML metadata is included in the extracted scripts?

Yes! Use the `include-yaml` option:

```yaml
---
title: "My Analysis"
filters:
  - ripper
extensions:
  ripper:
    include-yaml: false  # Extracts only code, no YAML data
---
```

**Default behavior** (`include-yaml: true`): YAML metadata is included as commented lines at the top of each script.

**Code-only extraction** (`include-yaml: false`): Only the raw code is extracted with no YAML comments.

## How are YAML comments formatted for different languages?

The extension automatically selects the appropriate comment style for each language:

- **Languages using `#'`**: R, Python, Julia, Bash, Ruby, Perl
- **Languages using `//'`**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, C++, C, Java, Scala, PHP
- **SQL**: Uses `--'` for comments

For example, in R:

```r
#' ---
#' title: My Analysis
#' ---
#' 
```

In JavaScript:

```js
//' ---
//' title: My Analysis
//' ---
//' 
```

## Does {ripper} work with all Quarto output formats?

Yes! Since `{ripper}` operates at the Pandoc AST level before format-specific rendering, 
it works with all Quarto output formats including HTML, PDF, Word, EPUB, and more. The 
script extraction happens regardless of your document's output format.

## Can I customize the output filename?

The output filename is automatically determined from your source document name. For example:

- `analysis.qmd` → `analysis.R`, `analysis.py`, etc.
- `report.qmd` → `report.R`, `report.py`, etc.

Currently, custom output filenames require modifying the `ripper.lua` file.

## Can I change the output directory for extracted scripts?

Scripts are created in the same directory as the rendered output file. To change this location, 
you would need to modify the `ripper.lua` file to specify a different output path.

# Behavior and Features

## What languages are supported?

The extension supports 16 programming languages:

| Language   | Extension | Comment Style |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| R          | `.R`      | `#'`          |
| Python     | `.py`     | `#'`          |
| Julia      | `.jl`     | `#'`          |
| Bash       | `.sh`     | `#'`          |
| JavaScript | `.js`     | `//'`         |
| TypeScript | `.ts`     | `//'`         |
| SQL        | `.sql`    | `--'`         |
| Rust       | `.rs`     | `//'`         |
| Go         | `.go`     | `//'`         |
| C++        | `.cpp`    | `//'`         |
| C          | `.c`      | `//'`         |
| Java       | `.java`   | `//'`         |
| Scala      | `.scala`  | `//'`         |
| Ruby       | `.rb`     | `#'`          |
| Perl       | `.pl`     | `#'`          |
| PHP        | `.php`    | `//'`         |

## Are code chunk options included in the extracted scripts?

No, code chunk options (like `#| label:`, `#| echo:`, `#| warning:`) are **not** included in the extracted scripts.
These options are processed by Quarto before the Lua filter runs and are not accessible to the filter.

The extension extracts:

- YAML metadata (optional, as comments)
- Raw code blocks (always)
- Execution order (preserved)

It does not extract:

- Code chunk options
- Chunk-level configuration

## How does {ripper} handle multiple code blocks in the same language?

All code blocks in the same language are combined into a single file, separated by blank lines.
The order is preserved exactly as it appears in your document.

For example, if you have three R code blocks:

```{{r}}
x <- 1
```

```{{r}}
y <- 2
```

```{{r}}
z <- x + y
```

They become one `document.R` file:

```r
x <- 1

y <- 2

z <- x + y
```

## What happens if my document has no code blocks?

If no code blocks with supported languages are found, the extension will not create any script files.
Your document renders normally without any side effects.

## Does {ripper} affect the original document rendering?

No, the original document rendering is completely unchanged. The extension only creates additional
script files as a side effect of the rendering process. Your HTML, PDF, or other output remain
exactly as it would be without the extension.

## Can I exclude certain code blocks from being extracted?

The current version extracts all code blocks with supported language identifiers.

Future versions may include built-in exclusion options.

# Troubleshooting

## Script files aren't being created. What should I do?

First, ensure that:

1. The `{ripper}` extension is properly installed in your `_extensions/coatless-quarto/ripper/` directory
2. You've added `filters: - ripper` to your document's YAML front matter (note the hyphen!)
3. Your document contains code blocks with supported language identifiers
4. You have write permissions in the output directory
5. You're using Quarto v1.7 or later

Check the Quarto rendering output for any error messages from the filter.

## I set `include-yaml: false` but still see comments in my output

Double-check your YAML structure. The configuration must be nested under `extensions.ripper`:

**Correct:**

```yaml
extensions:
  ripper:
    include-yaml: false
```

**Incorrect:**

```yaml
ripper:
  include-yaml: false
```

## My code blocks have `#|` options but they don't appear in the extracted scripts

This is expected behavior. Code chunk options like `#| label:`, `#| echo:`, and `#| warning:` are processed by
Quarto before the filter runs and are not accessible for extraction. The filter extracts only
the actual code content.

## Can I use {ripper} with other Quarto extensions?

Yes, `{ripper}` is designed to work alongside other Quarto extensions. If you encounter conflicts, 
try adjusting the order of filters in your YAML front matter. Generally, `{ripper}` should be placed
after filters that modify code blocks.

## The extension creates files but they're empty

Check that your code blocks have the correct language identifier syntax.
The language must be specified immediately after the opening backticks:

**Correct:**
````markdown
```{{r}}
code here
```
````

**Incorrect:**
````markdown
``` r
code here
```
````

Also ensure the language identifier matches the supported languages exactly (case-sensitive).

## How can I add support for additional languages?

Edit the `_extensions/coatless-quarto/ripper/ripper.lua` file and add entries to both tables:

```lua
-- Add file extension
lang_extensions = {
  ...
  matlab = ".m",
}

-- Add comment style
comment_styles = {
  ...
  matlab = "#'",
}
```

After making changes, re-render your document.

# Advanced Usage

## Can I extract code from multiple documents at once?

Yes, simply add the `{ripper}` filter to each document's YAML front matter. Each document
will generate its own set of script files named after the source document.

## Can I version control the extracted scripts?

Yes, though you may want to add them to `.gitignore` and regenerate them during your build process instead. 
Since they're automatically generated from your Quarto documents, tracking both can lead to redundant changes.

Alternatively, you can commit them to version control to provide easy access to standalone scripts without 
requiring Quarto to be installed.

# Support

## Where can I find examples of {ripper} in use?

The extension includes two example documents in the `docs/` directory:

- `qripper-mixed.qmd` - Multiple languages with YAML metadata
- `qripper-minimal.qmd` - Code-only extraction

Each example includes expected output files in the `docs/` directory.
