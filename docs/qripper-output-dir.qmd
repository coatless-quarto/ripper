## Overview

This document demonstrates the `output-dir` option, which saves generated scripts to a separate directory instead of alongside the source document.

The document configuration is:

````markdown
---
title: "Custom Output Directory"
format: html
extensions:
  ripper:
    output-dir: scripts
filters:
  - ripper
---
````

With this configuration, the extracted scripts will be saved to a `scripts/` folder relative to this document's location. The directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

### Common Patterns

**Save to a scripts folder next to the document:**

```yaml
output-dir: "scripts"
```

**Save to project root when document is in a subdirectory:**

```yaml
# If document is in docs/, this saves to project-root/scripts/
output-dir: "../scripts"
```

**Combine with custom output name:**

```yaml
output-dir: "scripts"
output-name: "analysis"  # Creates scripts/analysis.R, scripts/analysis.py
```

## R Code

```{r}
#| label: r-example
data <- mtcars
summary(data$mpg)
```

## Python Code

```{python}
#| label: python-example
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"Sum: {sum(numbers)}")
```
