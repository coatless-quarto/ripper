## Introduction

This is a RevealJS presentation showing how the `ripper` extension integrates with slides to provide code extraction and links.

## Ripper Integration

When rendered as a RevealJS presentation, the extension automatically:

1. Detects RevealJS format
2. Creates a non-titled slide (e.g. empty `##`)
3. Adds Code links
4. Places at end of presentation (can be configured)

## Example Configuration

The extension in the YAML front matter can be set up as follows:

```yaml
title: "My RevealJS Presentation"
author: "Your Name"
format: revealjs
echo: true
extensions:
  ripper:
    script-links-position: top
filters: [ripper]
```

:::{.callout-important}
The `echo: true` option is set to ensure that code chunks are displayed in the slides and, thus, can be extracted by the `ripper` extension.
