`ripper` is a Quarto extension that automatically extracts code blocks from your documents and splits them by programming language into separate, executable script files.

## Installation

To install the `ripper` Quarto extension, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Execute the following command:

```sh
quarto add coatless-quarto/ripper
```

This command will download and install the Quarto extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory of your Quarto project. If you are using version control, ensure that you include this directory in your repository.

## Usage

Add the `ripper` filter to your document's YAML front matter:

````md
---
title: "My Analysis"
filters:
  - ripper
---

```{r}
data <- mtcars
summary(data)
```

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({"x": [1, 2, 3]})
```
````

Render your document with Quarto:

```bash
quarto render my-analysis.qmd
```

Extracted scripts will be created in the same directory with names based on your document file name, e.g.

- `my-analysis.R` - All R code extracted
- `my-analysis.py` - All Python code extracted

## Configuration

Ripper supports a single global option called `include-yaml` under `extensions.ripper`:

```yaml
---
filters:
  - ripper
extensions:
  ripper:
    include-yaml: false   # Include YAML as comments (default: true)
---
```

### Option: `include-yaml`

- **`true` (default)**: Includes YAML frontmatter as commented lines at the top of each script
- **`false`**: Extracts only code with no YAML comments
